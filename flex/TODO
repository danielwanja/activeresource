Next:

* nested resources

Then:

* Add nested attributes error handling
* date transformation (using introspection)
* Number transformation (using introspection) (will fix a_decimal as string issue)
* Simplified API, i.e. allow for instance.save()
* Authenticity Token support
* Multiple baseUrl support (i.e. one resource goes against serverA and the other serverB);
* Custom verbs support
* Multiple associations data type i.e. ArrayCollection, Array, Vector...

To think about:

* pass conditions to the findAll ?
