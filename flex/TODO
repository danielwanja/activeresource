Next:

* Simplified API, i.e. allow for instance.save() 
  and ActiveResource.create(Employee, employee) should be ActiveResource.create(employee)

Then:

* Add nested attributes error handling
* Authenticity Token support
* Multiple baseUrl support (i.e. one resource goes against serverA and the other serverB);
* Custom verbs support
* Multiple associations data type i.e. ArrayCollection, Array, Vector...
