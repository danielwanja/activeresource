This document contains several design decisions or thoughts I'll make along the way:

8/27/2011 Inflector, need to get a proper ActionScript library to get String inflection functionality. Looked at https://github.com/danschultz/mesh which seems quite nice, but I'm using http://ak33m.com/?p=43 for now as it's just one file.

8/23/2011 I might require attributes declaration after all. That way I can introspect the resource and identify each attribute type. That solves the issue of needing a separate method to identify dates and also solves the issue of decimals coming across as strings. Further more using some annotations for associations, like RestfulX, I could do something with the has_many, and belongs_to...but that's for later.

8/16/2011 
- XML or JSON. JSON it is as it seem that Rails 3.1 doesn't even generate the respond_to for XML by default. In addition the bulk_data_source_flex project uses JSON and I want to merge it into the ActiveResource project at a later stage. 

- To extend the DRY principal from Rails to Flex the ActiveResource is dynamic and you don't need to declare (or repeat) the attributes of the ActiveRecord. One drawback is that I need a way to identify date columns, so I will add a date_column method that allows to declare what the dates are i.e. date_column([created_at, update_at, birthday]).
