This document contains several design decisions or thoughts I'll make along the way:

- XML or JSON. JSON it is as it seem that Rails 3.1 doesn't even generate the respond_to for XML by default. In addition the bulk_data_source_flex project uses JSON and I want to merge it into the ActiveResource project at a later stage. 

- To extend the DRY principal from Rails to Flex the ActiveResource is dynamic and you don't need to declare (or repeat) the attributes of the ActiveRecord. One drawback is that I need a way to identify date columns, so I will add a date_column method that allows to declare what the dates are i.e. date_column([created_at, update_at, birthday]).
